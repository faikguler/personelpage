      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
	  
	  My name is Faik, and I graduated from Trakya University in 2018 with a degree in Computer Engineering. I have been continuously developing my skills in the field of computers since my childhood. In late 2019, I moved from Turkey to the United Kingdom. However, I did not have the opportunity to fully pursue my profession due to also focusing on improving my English. I am currently trying to change my career path in order to pursue my desired profession. Therefore, I would like to participate in this program. Furthermore, I completed all of the given tasks in this program within 4-5 hours, including the uploads. However, since I realized it was the last day, I could not allocate enough time. I quickly attempted to complete all the requirements to the best of my ability.
</p><p>

	  As a highly motivated individual with a passion for technology, I have gained a wealth of over 10 years diverse experience through my participation in various successful projects. My solution-focused approach and ability to find creative solutions to complex problems has been a defining characteristic of my professional journey. With a proven track record of delivering results such as e-commerce system, real-time data monitoring and business tracking software, I am confident in my ability to make a valuable contribution to any organization within the technology sector.

	  <h2>TEAM LEADER - Skill city (Project BASED) </h2>
	  <p>
	  As the Project Leader at Skill City, I am currently leading the development of an e-commerce system using the Django framework. We are working on 5 different templates, each catering to a specific business group, with the ability for the client to customize the system in 3 different ways: basic pages for company introduction, product introduction without sales, and product sales. The system includes options for payment through Google Pay, Apple Pay, and PayPal, as well as an online booking system and other features to enhance user experience. The development is ongoing and new features will be added as needed.
